The reason why the moon appears as a white disk with constant brightness 
is because, there is a considerable distance between the sun and the moon.

the light direction is orthogonal to the moon 

il sole e' talmente lontano che i raggi gli arrivano come se fossero dritti
quindi ortogonali all luna
